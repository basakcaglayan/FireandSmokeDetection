# üî•  Fire and Smoke Detection with YOLO and Firebase

This project provides a complete solution for detecting fire in images and videos using deep learning and IoT-based techniques. It includes:

- A **fine-tuned YOLOv8 model** for real-time fire detection with bounding boxes.
- A **custom-built CNN classifier** trained from scratch for binary image classification (fire vs. no fire).
- Integration with **Firebase and ESP32-CAM** to monitor images uploaded in real time and trigger alerts via a **buzzer** if fire is detected.
- Webcam-based live detection for desktop setups using OpenCV.

The goal of this project is not only to compare the performance of state-of-the-art vs. from-scratch models, but also to implement a practical fire detection system using affordable IoT components and cloud storage.

## üìñ Documentation

### Project Overview

This project explores fire detection with:

- A **YOLOv8 model**, fine-tuned on a custom dataset of 9,000 fire and non-fire images created via [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/).
- A **custom CNN model** built using Keras for image classification.
- Real-time application using **ESP32-CAM**, which captures and uploads images to Firebase, and a Python script polls and processes the images to trigger a hardware alarm system.
### ‚ú® Features

- **Dual Modeling Approaches**: Object detection (YOLOv8) and binary image classification (CNN).
- **End-to-End Notebooks**: Easy-to-follow Jupyter Notebooks for each modeling method.
- **Fine-Tuned & From-Scratch Models**: Practical comparison of state-of-the-art and fundamental models.
- **Visualization Support**: Training history and model predictions visualized.
- **Lightweight Setup**: Simple environment setup with `requirements.txt`.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/basakcaglayan/FireDetection.git
cd FireDetection
```
### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
On macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Webcam Fire Detection
Run this script to detect fire using a standard webcam:

```bash
python yolo.py
```
### 2. Firebase + ESP32-CAM Detection (Real-Time)
Upload images from ESP32-CAM to Firebase. The Python script will:

- Download the most recent image
- Run detection using best.pt
- Trigger buzzer if fire is detected

```bash
python yolo_firebase2.py
```
### 3. Notebook-based Experiments
- FireDetection-Yolov8.ipynb: Train or fine-tune YOLOv8
- FireDetectionwith_CNN.ipynb: Train and evaluate the custom CNN
Launch notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
## Deployment
You can deploy the detection system on a local Raspberry Pi or any PC with a webcam. Connect a buzzer through GPIO or USB-controlled relay, and modify yolo_firebase2.py to send signals accordingly.
